# set-personal-data

A channel to interface with the regional `pd.dat` necessary for many Japanese channels.

You'll need a few packages in order to compile this channel:
 - `wii-libpatcher`, from our [repository](https://github.com/WiiLink24/repository)
 - `ppc-freetype`
 - `ppc-libvorbisidec`

It is currently still a work in progress.
